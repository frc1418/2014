        This is a class to show an OpenCV image in a GTK widget
        
        Initialized to a fixed size for now
        
        One way that you could do this is by just copying the OpenCV images
        to a pixbuf... but that would involve a lot of memory allocation and
        unnecessary copies. The way this works is we have a buffer stored
        that has a cairo surface associated with it, and we copy onto that
        and draw it using the expose event for the widget.
