Catapult

Motors:

One CIM. 

Actuators:
Piston, dog, gear, axil. 

Sensors:
None, I think. 

Functions:

launcher: controlled by one CIM, which turns on to wind up the winch, which draws catapult down into ready-to-fire position. 
Pnuematic piston will extend to pull dog out, and axil will free wheel, releasing the catapult. 
Returns to to default position, but must be winched down again to fire. 

Getting Ball: basket must be winched down to pick up off the floor.
Needs to be able to lower about half way if a human player is to load it.
