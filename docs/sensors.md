Ultrasonic sensor
=================

* Analog channel 3

Need to define a function to convert voltage to feet. It appears to be mostly
linear. The datasheet will help here (what is the part number?). The
approximate measurements we took were:

* 4 ft: 0.4v
* 6 ft: 0.6v
* 7 ft: 0.78v
* 8 ft: 0.9v
* 9 ft: 1.0v
* 10 ft: 1.1v
* 11 ft: 1.2v
