# 2014 Code - FRC Team 1418

This is the code for our 2014 season

The code is written in python using PyDev (pydev.org) for Eclipse (eclipse.org)  and the pyfrc libraries (link needed)

What it does:
* **Drive** - The robot uses a mecanum allowing it to strafe as well as drive normally
well, that all at the moment actually...
