This is the code for our 2014 season

The code is written in python using PyDev (pydev.org) for Eclipse (eclipse.org)  and the pyfrc libraries (link needed)

What it does:
* **Drive** - The robot uses a mecanum allowing it to strafe as well as drive normally

What it will do:
* **Collect** - The robot will collect giant balls from the floor using wheels on its arm
* **Store** - The robot will be able to hold a ball while it moves
* **Shoot** - The robot will be able to launch the stored ball

Thats all for now folks!
